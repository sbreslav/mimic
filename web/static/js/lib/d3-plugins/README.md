# D3 Plugins

This is a repository for sharing D3 plugins.

Each plugin should live in a directory that matches its name.

## Running Tests

The tests use [Vows](http://vowsjs.org), which depends on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](http://npmjs.org/). If you are developing on Mac OS X, an easy way to install Node and NPM is using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

    brew install node

Next, from the root directory of this repository, install dependencies:

    npm install

To run the tests, use:

    npm test
